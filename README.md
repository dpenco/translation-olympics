# translation-olympics
This repository is under active development. Expect frequent updates as the experiments are ongoing.

This is a collection of scripts used to quantitatively evaluate and compare the quality of Baidu, Bing, Google, Sogou and Yandex Translate.

The code is written in Python 3 (Python 2 not supported) and depends on Selenium's Python binding to scrape translation data.

The tests will be conducted using a subset of the Datum English-Chinese Parallel Corpus, made available for the 2017 WMT Conference.
